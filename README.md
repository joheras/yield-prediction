# Estimation of Crop Production by Fusing Images and Crop Features

This repository contains the code for the paper "Estimation of Crop Production by Fusing Images and Crop Features". 

The code is split into three folders:
- baseline: models trained only with images.
- multi-input: models trained combining images and crop features.
- multi-output: models trained to predict multiple features from a given image.
